# Community Bot For Treasure Key

This bot allows you to automate your strategy for the Treasure Key Bet games at [https://treasurekey.bet/](https://treasurekey.bet/)

## Why this?

Many gamers have been complaining about bots that have an "advantage" over average players, which led to the conception of this project. **If you can't stop them from botting, you beat them at their game.**

Frankly, what would set this apart from a regular old botting project, is the ability for you to tweak and create your own strategy with this bot. It requires the human aspect of __observation__, __understanding the data__, and __**optimizing for success.**__

## What features?

- Round start sniping mode
- AFK mode
- Controls to create and tweak your own strategy

## How to use?

1. Download the application from the release section. Only __windows version__ available for now
2. Install the application by double clicking it
3. Once launched, it will prompt you for your private keys (touchy i know, but do read the source code, there's nothing funny going on)
4. Once done, you will be presented with a screen that allows you to select the mode that you wish to use
5. Just tweak the controls, and click on the mode that you wish to start. It should be that simple!


## Word from developers

Use this product absolutely at your own risk. There's no gurantee that this bot is bug-free, nor is there any gurantee that you will win games with it. As always, read the code so you understand whether there's any possible untoward behavior.
